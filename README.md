# Project---Customer-Segmentation-Analysis

This project involved extensive data preprocessing and feature engineering, followed by univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis. After performing EDA, checking for multicollinearity, and scaling features, PCA was applied for dimensionality reduction. K-means clustering was identified as the best algorithm. Various classification models were evaluated using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC AUC, and Log Loss, with Randomforest emerging as the best model. The final model was then deployed for practical use.
